# Fine-Tuning-SAM-Segmentation-on-Custom-Dataset-for-Medical-Images-
This repository is inspired by Mazurowski Lab's finetune-SAM. In this repository, we provide a simple conversion of COCO datasets to the SAM format necessary for fine-tuning. Additionally, we include Weights &amp; Biases (wandb) visualization for tracking experiments and have fixed various code errors.
